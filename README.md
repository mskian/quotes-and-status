Share your thoughts: Simply type and post your status updates.  

**Note**  

I primarily built this tool for personal use, and I mostly run it on my home server or localhost.This tool is not recommended for production use, as it lacks additional security layers such as header authentication, API keys, or token methods to prevent unauthorized access. However, you are welcome to fork the project and make any changes as needed.

## Routes

## Database

- Create Folder Named `data` and create a JSON file to store the status Content
